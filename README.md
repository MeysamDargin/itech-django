# iTech - Modular Django Project

iTech is a modular Django application built with a microservices-inspired architecture. It integrates AI-powered recommendation systems and leverages multiple technologies to provide a scalable and modern solution.

## üåê Architecture

This project is designed with modularity in mind:

* **Modular Apps:** Each feature is isolated in its own Django app for scalability and maintainability.
* **Dockerized:** All services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.
* **Databases:**
  * **PostgreSQL** for relational data.
  * **MongoDB** for document-based storage.
* **Caching:** Redis is used for caching and asynchronous task management.
* **AI & Recommendations:** Integrated AI models provide recommendations and smart content suggestions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

* **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* **Cache:** Redis
* **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
* **AI & ML:** Python-based AI modules for recommendations
* **Task Queue:** Celery (with Redis broker)
